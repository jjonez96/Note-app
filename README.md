# My first react typescript project

What this project do?
<br>
Just simple note app. Basic add and delete features with typescript.

What i learned?
<br>
I learned the concepts of typescript, what typing means and what problems this solves.
At first it was kinda confusing, because the syntax is bit different to javascript.
This project made me realize how important typing is and i will dive deeper into this.
